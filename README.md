# Convertor Utility
This app allows you to convert images, audios and videos from one format to another.

**It also has drag-n-drop support for files.**

GUI made in python using `Tkinter` module.

**Now with HiDPI display support!**

Conversion made possible using `PIL` library and `ffmpeg`

### Prerequisites
